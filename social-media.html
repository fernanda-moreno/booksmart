            In Booksmart, Molly and Amy used Snapchat to view stories and try to find out where the party was taking
            place. They relied on their phones to get from place to place as they were searching for this information
            and finding rides to get there. This connects to our class discussions of how with technology, information
            is ubiquitous, easily accessible at the tip of our fingers or by the commands of our voice, and how it’s so
            integrated into our daily lives as we seek for answers. Molly and Amy’s use of Snapchat to see how the party
            is going and to try to figure out where it is relates to the article How Social Media Shapes Our Identity by
            Nausicaa Renner. In that article, Renner mentioned that “Teen-agers are cyborgs, and their phones are
            mechanical eyes that help them interpret their experience.” In Booksmart, the main characters Molly and Amy
            were regretful of their choice to work hard and not party because they saw that their classmates who chose
            to party hard still got into the same top schools as they did.
            <br></br>
            It’s not directly addressed in the film, but from the glimpses we saw of their use of Snapchat, we can
            assume that they’ve used social media to see what
            their peers are up to and compare their own experiences with that of their peers. Using social media to see
            what others are up to can oftentimes make us feel envious of how others are spending their time and the
            lives that they appear to lead, and this is how Molly and Amy felt when they realized that they didn’t have
            to work as hard as they did and sacrifice partying to get into good schools. They may not have used social
            media to find out that their peers got into good schools, but they did use social media to keep tabs on what
            their peers were up to that night of that party (and presumably all 4 years of high school) and ultimately
            draw comparisons to their own lives. This use of social media, or Snapchat in particular, is an example of
            hypermediated immediacy. From what Molly and Amy see on Snapchat, they draw conclusions not only where the
            party is but about how it’s going and how much fun others are having. They are drawn into the moment of each
            story or post that they see, and it’s hard for them to distinguish what is real versus what the people in
            these Snapchat stories are actually doing or what they’re actually feeling. More specifically, assuming that
            Molly and Amy used social media to keep up with what their peers were doing, they weren’t able to decipher
            from these posts that their peers actually had good school and work habits that allowed them to get into top
            colleges.
            <br></br>
            Watch the scene below (starting at 01:38) where Molly's perceived idea of her peers, likely formed from her observations of them
            at school and social media, clashes with the reality of the kind of students and people they are.
