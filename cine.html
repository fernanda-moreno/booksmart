        <h1>Cinematography</h1>
    </br>
        <img class="palette" src="images/palette.jpg" alt="Booksmart color palette" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
        </br>
        </br>
        <p>The cinematographer of Booksmart was Jason McCormick. Throughout the film, we see a lot of blues, yellows,
            and browns/oranges. The film also has a slightly faded quality to it that makes it feel like a classic while
            simultaneously radiating 2019 energy. Let’s talk about the importance of colors in the film.
        </p>
        <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 18px;">
            <li><b>Blues: cold, isolation, cerebral, melancholy, passivity, calm</b></li>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/freakout.png" alt="Molly freaking out" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
            <img class="palette" src="images/hallway.png" alt="Molly freaking out in hallway" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
        </br>
            <p>In the scene of Molly’s freakout when she finds out that her partying peers also got into top
                universities, the walls all around her, in the bathroom, and in some parts of the hallway, are blue,
                representing her isolation in that moment as she’s experiencing a mental freakout.
            </p>
        </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/dance.png" alt="Molly and Nick dancing" hspace="30" width="460" height="250"
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto;">
            </br>
            <p>We also see blue in the dance sequence between Molly and Nick. There are some other colors that appear in
                that scene (which we’ll discuss further in a moment), but the transition to blue in the middle of their
                dance also represents their isolation from everyone else in the party at that moment. It is only the two
                of them that exist in Molly’s imagination and no one else matters. It also represents a sense of
                calmness, as Molly imagines this closeness between her and Nick that we hadn’t seen before in the film.
            </p>
        </br>
        <img class="palette" src="images/pool.png" alt="Amy in the pool" hspace="30" width="460" height="250"
        style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto;">
    </br>
            <p>Ah, the magnificent pool scene. The main color throughout this scene is blue, and it highlights the
                calmness that Amy feels as she’s swimming through people in the water. The blue also represents
                passivity, as Amy is quite literally passing through a bunch of people unnoticed and unbothered. At the
                end of the pool scene, we see the moment Amy sees Ryan and Nick together, and the color of the scene
                remains blue, but gets slightly darker. The blue is still very fitting at this part because it
                represents Amy’s sadness, not only for herself but for Molly, because both of them had been misreading
                the situation all along.</p>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/molly-amy.png" alt="Molly and Amy" hspace="30" width="460" height="300"
            style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto;">
        </br>
            <p>Blue is also pretty consistent in the attire of Molly and Amy throughout the film. Blue is said to be a
                color that represents cerebral, and I think this is fitting because Molly and Amy are both brainiacs.
                They’re intelligent women and students who are headed to Ivy League universities. They’re also both
                generally calm people, and it seems as though they have been pretty passive throughout most of their
                four years in high school, as they’ve stayed out of trouble and avoided partying like most of their
                peers.</p>
            <li><b>Yellows: madness, sickness, insecurity, obsessive, idyllic, naive</b></li>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/Booksmart3.jpg" alt="Molly freakout" hspace="30" width="460" height="250"
            style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto;">
        </br>
            <p>In the scene where Molly is freaking out, we discussed the blues in the background, but it is also
                important to note the color yellow on her shirt. In this scene, Molly is mentally going insane and we
                see her express this as she walks through the hallway yelling at her peers to ask them where they’re
                going to school. We can tell that she’s desperate for this information, as she goes around asking nearly
                everyone for an answer, and it goes to show this obsession she’s had with the idea of her success and
                superiority. </p>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/grad.png" alt="Molly and Amy at graduation" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
            <img class="palette" src="images/grad2.png" alt="Graduation" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
            <img class="palette" src="images/grad3.png" alt="Graduation" hspace="30" width="460" height="250"
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto; margin-top: 1em;">
            </br>
            <p>We also see the combination of blue and yellow present in the graduation gown and stoles at the end of
                the film. We talked about the meaning of the blues to represent cerebral and melancholy, highlighting
                the smart students and the sort of sadness that naturally appears on graduation days, but what the
                yellow adds to this
                is a sense of naiveness, because these students are young and naive, and also blissfulness, because
                they’re getting out of high school!</p>
            <li><b>Browns/Oranges: warmth, sociability, friendly, happiness, exotic, youth</b></li>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/bedroom.png" alt="Molly and Amy in Amy's bedroom" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
            <img class="palette" src="images/sex.png" alt="Amy and Hope" hspace="30" width="460" height="250">
            </br>
            <p>Booksmart is tinted with brown and orange throughout the film, but some scenes where it is more
                explicitly present are in the scene of the party where Amy is singing karaoke, in Amy’s bedroom when
                she’s getting ready for the night with Molly, and in the scene where Amy and Hope try to have sex. The
                brownish orange colors in these scenes represent many things: Molly and Amy being more social than
                they’ve ever been by going to multiple parties in one night, happiness (particularly from the moments of
                dancing and laughter in the film), the unbreakable friendship between Molly and Amy, and above all, the
                youthfulness of all the characters in how they navigate conflict, adventures, friendships, and sex at
                this point in their life. </p>
            </br>
            <li><b>Pinks: innocence, sweetness, femininity, playful, empathy, beauty</b></li>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/pink.jpg" alt="Doll scene pink bedroom" hspace="30" width="560" height="250"
            style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto; margin-top: 1em;">
        </br>
            <p>The color pink is another one that makes consistent appearances throughout the film. We see pink in the
                bedroom color of the doll scene where Molly and Amy are experiencing their drug hallucination. The pink
                in this scene highlights femininity and playfulness, just as the dolls themselves do. It’s also sort of
                a darkened pink scene, perhaps to represent that it’s not a typically girly or playful scene but one
                where Molly and Amy are experiencing panic and entrapment. </p>
            </br>
                <img class="palette" src="images/amy-sing.png" alt="Amy singing" hspace="30" width="460" height="250"
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto; margin-top: 1em;">
            </br>
            <p>We also see the color pink in the scene where Amy is singing karaoke at Nick’s party. This scene was
                beautiful because we see that Amy sings really well, the audience loves her, and she’s genuinely
                enjoying herself despite being shy at first. The pink in this scene was important as it shows Amy’s
                playfulness, her ability to let loose, have fun, and enjoy this period of her youth. </p>
            </br>
            <img class="palette" src="images/pink-dance.png" alt="Molly and Nick dancing" hspace="30" width="460" height="250"
                style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-content: center; margin: auto; margin-top: 1em;">
        </br>
            <p>Pink, of course, is also present in Molly and Nick’s famous dance sequence. The variety of colors in this
                scene represents the abundance of emotions for Molly, but the pink in particular highlights the
                sweetness, playfulness, and beauty of this scene. It’s an innocent imagination that Molly has when she
                first arrives at the party and it really shows how much of a romantic she actually is. </p>
