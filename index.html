        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <p>Two best friends, Molly and Amy, are just about finished with their senior year of high school and they’re
            both
            looking forward to attending Ivy League universities after working long and hard for the past four years.
            When
            they learn that their peers who partied all throughout high school also got into the same top universities,
            Molly and Amy become regretful of their decision to sacrifice partying in order to work, so they try to make
            up
            for it by going to a party on their last night before graduation. </p>

                        Molly is a senior in high school, best friend to Amy, and she is headed to Yale University in
                        the upcoming fall. She is also the senior class president and works alongside Nick, the senior
                        class vice president, who is pretty popular and known to goof off a lot. Molly acts as though
                        she hates working with Nick, but she has a secret crush on him that is later revealed in the
                        film. Her crush on Nick is part of the reason why she's so insistent on going to his party the
                        night before graduation.

                        Amy is a senior in high school, best friend to Molly, and she is headed to Columbia University.
                        Amy has been out as a lesbian for a few years already, and she has a crush
                        on this girl named Ryan. Right after graduation, Amy plans on spending time in Africa to help
                        create period products for women who may not have access to them. Amy doesn't care about going
                        to the party as much as Molly does, but she still goes along for the ride and finds herself
                        having unexpected fun at times.

        <p><i>“Society encourages us to value romantic relationships so much more than our friendships. [It suggests if]
                we
                do not have a romantic partner, we’re missing something in life. For young women, it’s important to
                encourage the respect and support among friends. There’s been far too much content encouraging a
                competitive
                relationship between women and we have to unravel that because it has pretty devastating
                consequences.”</i> - Olivia Wilde in
