    <h1>Long Takes</h1>
    <br></br>
    <div class="container">
        <p><i>"The substance of cinema is therefore an endless long take, as is reality to our senses for as long as we
                are
                able to see and feel (a long take that ends with the end of our lives); and this long take is nothing
                but the
                reproduction of the language of reality. In other words it is the reproduction of the present."</i>

        <h2>Molly and Nick Dance Scene</h2>
        <iframe class="video" width="450" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxYCNmYhpxk" frameborder="0"

            allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>When Molly and Amy finally arrive at Nick’s party, the party they’ve been searching for almost the entire
            film up until this point, Molly spots Nick and the rest of the world begins to fade away. The scene breaks
            into a dance sequence between Molly and Nick, an imagined encounter that takes place in Molly’s head. Here,
            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/movies/booksmart-clip.html" target="_blank"
                style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">according to Olivia Wilde</a>, is where it is revealed
            that Molly has been the most romantic person in the room
            the whole time.
            <br></br>
            What’s impressive about this scene is that it was filmed in one shot, and the actor who plays Nick, Mason
            Gooding, had never danced before in his life (at least professionally). Wilde said that with this scene, she
            wanted to pay an homage
            to classic Hollywood musicals. This reminded me of <a href="https://vimeo.com/28016704" target="_blank"
                style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">Matthias Stork’s point in his Chaos Cinema video essay</a>
            of
            how chaos cinema is sometimes used in musical dance numbers and how it reduces the quality of the overall
            scene.
            Take the dance sequences in the movie Chicago, for example, which show many cuts and practically force the
            audience's eye on where to look at every moment (Frankly, I love this song and performance, but I still
            think long takes do dance performances more justice).
        </p>

            allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>
            And compare that with this dance scene from Singin' in the Rain, which has longer takes and less cuts that
            allow us to feel present in the moment with Gene Kelly. These longer takes and longer shots allow the
            audience to make the decision of what they should be paying attention to. The eye of the audience is
            unmanipulated, replicating the experience of real life.

        <p>
            The dance scene from Olivia Wilde’s Booksmart more closely resembles the style of the dance scene in Singin'
            in
            the Rain because of the long take. The long take in the dance sequence allowed us to feel present in the
            intimate, imagined moment with Molly and Nick. Even though it wasn’t real, for the moment that it lasted, we
            as viewers were able to witness the romance and connection between the characters and feel like we were just
            following Molly and Nick wherever they were taking us.
            <br></br>
            Also, has no one else imagined a scenario in their heads of making eye contact with their crush at a party
            and breaking into a dance sequence like this? Maybe I’m embarrassing myself here but personally, I’ve had
            imaginations
            just like this, and this moment in the film felt as though it were a daydream from my own mind.
            <br></br>

        <h2>Molly and Amy Argument Scene</h2>
        <iframe class="video" width="450" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7V-w0dxZDw" frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br></br>
        <p>
            While Molly and Amy are at Nick’s party, Amy finds out that Nick and Ryan (Molly’s crush and Amy’s crush)
            have a fling going on when she sees the two of them kissing in the pool. Amy becomes distraught and goes to
            find Molly to try and convince her that they should go home so that Molly doesn’t see Nick and Ryan together
            and become as heartbroken as Amy did. When Amy tells Molly that she wants to leave, Molly starts telling Amy
            that she
            should get over herself and that they should just stay and have fun. This leads to one of the most dramatic
            scenes in the film, with
            Amy and Molly arguing loudly in front of everyone at the party, many of whom pull out their phones to record
            the dispute.
            <br></br>
            The long take begins at the end of Amy’s pool scene (which is a whole other chef’s kiss of a scene) and we
            get to follow Amy as she rushes inside the house to find Molly. Because the long take begins here, we’re
            able to see the build up of Amy witnessing something heartbreaking, her desperately searching for her best
            friend for comfort, and ultimately getting into a public argument with her best friend even though she was
            just trying to protect her from getting hurt. This single, long shot is what allowed for the anxiety in the
            moment to grow, and for viewers to feel that anxiety. We know what Amy has just witnessed and why she’s so
            upset, but we see the moment Amy finds Molly and can tell that Molly has no idea what Amy just went through.
            Molly is initially feeling excited when she sees Amy, saying that things between her and Nick are going well
            that night and that he was being flirty. We see Molly’s mood begin to shift when she notices that Amy is
            upset and wants to leave the party. Molly experienced a drastic shift in mood in the span of a minute, and
            we as viewers were able to witness this shift in real time in the single shot. <a
                href="https://variety.com/2019/artisans/awards/olivia-wilde-booksmart-fight-scene-1203452226/"
                target="_blank" style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">As Olivia Wilde herself put it</a>,
            editing in film is a way of presenting an argument for the viewer. With the long take, they’re not
            cutting it up for us and telling us how to perceive it. We’re seeing the argument unfold in real time while
            being able to acknowledge both sides of it together at once.
            <br></br>
            The impact of this scene is heightened even more when the dialogue is stripped away and replaced with sad
            music. At this point, we understand that the argument is spiraling out of control, so it doesn’t really
            matter what Molly and Amy saying because we know how both of them are feeling and we’re able
            to see it in their faces. This level of sadness and argument with a loved one is also something that a lot
            of us, if not all of us, have experienced in our lives. We see the argument and the look on the characters’
            faces and we’re able to feel what they’re feeling because it’s almost an inevitable experience in life.
            <a href="https://variety.com/2019/artisans/awards/olivia-wilde-booksmart-fight-scene-1203452226/"
                target="_blank" style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">As
                Wilde put it</a>, the cutting of the sound allows for the audience to project their worst arguments into
            this
            scene and feel that moment with the characters.
            <br></br>

            how this scene was crafted.
